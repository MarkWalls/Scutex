You can also have edition based licensing to unlock only select features based on the level of the license.

Infragistics Components
-------

Currently Scutex uses Infragistics WPF v10.3 components inside the Management and Licensing projects. Although this dependency is being reworked to allow for everyone to build the projects this is currently not the case.  You can install a trial version of Infragistics WPF components and relink the references or if you already have Infragistics WPF installed you can just relink to your installed version.

Official Builds & Releases
--------------

There are a number of additional processes that occur for preparing Scutex to be used in your applications.
